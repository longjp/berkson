Code for producing results in Finite Sample and Real Data sections of "Kernel Density Estimation with Berkson Error" by Long, El Karoui, and Rice.

run.R runs all code to produce all tables and figures in manuscript

== Finite Sample ==
sim.R - makes tables and figures in main body of manuscript
sim_appendix.R - makes tables in appendix (with estimated bandwidths)
functions.R - computes and optimizes MISE, computes asymptotically opt h
unit_tests.R - testing module for verifying accuracy of functions in functions.R

== Real Data ==
The data is contained in the folder data. The file watertown.R loads the data files and writes output
to figs/.
